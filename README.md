# Features
- Login/logout
- Emulate CLI
- Get absolute paths using file chooser 

# Brief

This is a PoC for Accenture. Getting the absolute path using the controller /upload/run is not possible because the server side is not capable of getting the path for security reasons. Unless you are doing a monolithic architecture, then yes but in this case, it is not. We are using ReactJS for this PoC.

# Instructions

- Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed in your machine. 
- Use command `npm install` to install the necessary packages. 
- Use command `npm run start` to start the application. After startup, it will automatically open the application to your browser.

Use either of these 3 to login:
- test@gmail.com:password
- test2@gmail.com:password
- test3@gmail.com:password

## Note

This port is set to 8080 while the frontend is set to 3000.
